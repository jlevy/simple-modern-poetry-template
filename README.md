## Installing Python, pipx, and Poetry

Sadly, there are many, many ways to install and set up your Python environment, each
with its own pitfalls.

This is a quick cheat sheet for one of the simplest and most reliable ways to set up
**Python 3.11+** and **Poetry 2.0+** (what you should use as of 2025) using
[**pyenv**](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and
[**pipx**](https://github.com/pypa/pipx).

For macOS:

```shell
brew update
brew install pyenv pipx
```

For Ubuntu:

```shell
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
apt install pipx
```

Now you can install a current Python and Poetry:

```shell
pyenv install 3.12.9  # Pick the version you want.
pipx install poetry
```

For Windows or other platforms, see the pyenv and poetry instructions. 

## Development

For development workflows, see [development.md](development.md).
